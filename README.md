# Samantha Nyquist

My name is Samantha Nyquist, however most people call me Sammy. I just recieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Welcome to my silly GitHub page with some rough evidence of attempting to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with some other programming things here and there. 

I appreciate your understanding of the fact that my entire profile is a work in progress as I find time to learn new programming skills and update this as I do.

Thank you for stopping by!
